# Modular display system, Generation 4, Driver

Hardware for the driver board. Find more information on the [Modular LED Display website](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/) under the [Generation 4](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/docs/g4_system.html) menu.

The whole system of the previous 3rd generation modular displays was described in the following publication. A methods paper addressing Generation 4 is in preparation.
