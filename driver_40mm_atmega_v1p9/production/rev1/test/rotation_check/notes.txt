The BOM and CPL files in the this directory have been created to help check the
orientations of the components. 

Some of the parts in the BOM have been replaced with similar, but incorrect,
components which will display correctly during JLCPCB submission processes.  

These files should NOT be used when ordering the PCBs!!!!!
